@race_results_clean_2001-2017.csv
- Will use team average finish position for last 3, 5, 10 races in first race cases
- Do this once merging and calculating finish position for 2018+ drivers

@flag_results_raw.csv
- Combine SC and VSC laps into % of total laps under a SC

@lap_data_raw.csv 
- Will need to do a left/right merge with driver finish status
    - If driver didnt finish at least 1 lap, will have no laptime in the @lap_data_raw.csv and wont have a driver_id or name
- Change columns like laps_on_soft to % of total laps
- Make sure datatypes are correct

@pratice_results_raw.csv
- When cleaning practice times will need to replace "NULL" with NaN

@starting_grid_results_raw.csv, @qualifying_results_raw.csv, @race_results_raw_2018+.csv
- When cleaning the qualifying, results, and starting grid data, will have to keep in mind that some races dont have a 20th place
    - I think this is because if a driver has to start from the pit lane because of penalties or changing car parts, they dont get put on the starting grid
    - I'm not sure if there are races where multiple drivers have this and so the max start position is 18th or something. Will have to look into it further when cleaning
    - For these could impute places or append "pit lane" or something
        - Will have to compare drivers that finished to drivers that started to find discrepencies
